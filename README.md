# ghostsurn

Javascript app. A tile layout method, similar to my previous [Ghost Diagrams](http://logarithmic.net/pfh/ghost-diagrams) and [Maxim Gumin](https://twitter.com/ExUtumno)'s [WaveFunctionCollapse](https://github.com/mxgmn/WaveFunctionCollapse)). The novelty here is that this app aims to find a uniformly random sample rather than only find an example. The uniformity of the randomness of is not 100% perfect, but perfection can be approached by increasing the "effort" parameter. I'm not really sure what the point of this is, but it [tickles](https://twitter.com/paulfharrison/status/1438466031488421888) at some broad ideas.
