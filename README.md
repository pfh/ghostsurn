# ghostsurn

Experimental javascript app, under development. A tile layout method (see my Ghost Diagrams and mxgmn's WaveFunctionCollapse), that aims to sample rather than only find an example.

To run locally:

```
git clone https://github.com/pfh/ghostsurn.git
cd ghostsurn
python3 -m http.server
```
